FIX:
 - If two directories are the same, do not compare files within those directories. This may be difficult. Godspeed, developer.

FLAGS:
 - Add flag to exclude .git folders
 - Make md5sum not shown on default, have flag to show it
 - -h to show flags and directions
 - add option to auto-delete duplicates (which location???)
 - Reading entire file path is hard, have option to suppress identical sections of file path
 - Allow user to input file path that it starts on (default .)
    - Make sure user can physically enter ., or enter ./extra_path
